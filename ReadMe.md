This is a modification based on Pieter Koornhof's EasyEventSourcing project.

It adds the missing read side of the event sourcing and add the capability to use a MongoDB as an alternative to the default In-Memory database.

The project contains in addition to the extended console a simple API to serve an angular application which can be found in my projects.

Feel free to feedback, discuss or contribute!
